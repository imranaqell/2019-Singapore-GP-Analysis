Charles Leclerc secured pole position in the 2019 Singapore GP, marking his 5th pole position in his career. His pole time of 1:36:217 was two tenths slower than Lewis Hamilton's track record set the previous year.

The majority of the time that Charles Leclerc lost was primarily in the medium and low-speed corners, where Lewis Hamilton, driving the Mercedes W09, demonstrated superior performance. Hamilton consistently excelled in navigating these corners and even surpassed the qualifying lap simulation set by Mercedes.

Nevertheless, the Ferrari SF90 gained notable advantage in straight-line speed, registering at least a 5km/h advantage over the Mercedes W09. However, the nature of the Singapore GP track favors cars with exceptional cornering speed. This underscores the significance of a vehicle's medium and low cornering capabilities in such conditions.

**Sebastian Vettel's Decisive Outlap in the 2019 Singapore GP**

The 2019 Singapore GP was claimed by Sebastian Vettel, representing his 53rd career win and serving as his final victory prior to his retirement in 2022. In the 2019 Singapore GP, Sebastian Vettel's performance notably ranked among his finest, as he effectively maintained pace alongside his enthusiastic young teammate, Charles Leclerc.

One pivotal moment of the race occurred when Vettel executed an undercut maneuver on his leading teammate. An undercut strategy involves a driver entering the pits before the cars ahead to secure a positional advantage. This strategy hinges on the team's belief that using fresher tires will yield greater speed and overall benefit compared to staying on the track until rival cars have pitted.

The subsequent crucial phase unfolded during the outlap. Sebastian Vettel's outlap during Lap 20 showcased exceptional performance, characterized by skillful tire heating without encountering understeer or oversteer issues, despite the tires being freshly out of the pit box.

Analyzing the telemetry data reveals distinctions between Lap 20 and Lap 24. Assumptions were made regarding the complete heating of the new Hard tires after 5 laps. Notably, minimal differences were observed in throttle and brake inputs, demonstrating Vettel's remarkable confidence in handling the Ferrari SF90.
